## Welcome my friend!

I am a computer science and mathematics student at the University of Wisconsin Whitewater.
My main languages are C++ and Python and my primary interests are computer graphics and mathematical modeling.
On the side, I create music and 3D art and occasionally dabble in making games.
I am working towards creating a virtual guitar amplifier and contributing to open-source software such as Blender, yet I still have a long way to go.
